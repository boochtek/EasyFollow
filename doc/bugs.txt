BUGS
====

1	OPEN	When I view any profile, I see the CraigBuchek Twitter account listed under my networks, no matter who I'm logged in as or looking at.
			Turns out, we're not storing the username/uid/full_name in SocialNetworkAccounts.
2	OPEN	The @who variable is not getting set when passed in via locals to user/profile partial.
			Perhaps the locals have to point at variables for some reason, and literals just don't work.
